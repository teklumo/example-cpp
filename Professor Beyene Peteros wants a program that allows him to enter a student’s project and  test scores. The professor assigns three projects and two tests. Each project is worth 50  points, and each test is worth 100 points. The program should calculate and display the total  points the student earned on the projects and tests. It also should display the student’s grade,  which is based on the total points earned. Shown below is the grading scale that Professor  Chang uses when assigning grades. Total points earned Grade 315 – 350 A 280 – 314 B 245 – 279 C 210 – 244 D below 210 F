/*   Professor Beyene Peteros wants a program that allows him to enter a student’s project and 
test scores. The professor assigns three projects and two tests. Each project is worth 50 
points, and each test is worth 100 points. The program should calculate and display the total 
points the student earned on the projects and tests. It also should display the student’s grade, 
which is based on the total points earned. Shown below is the grading scale that Professor 
Chang uses when assigning grades.
Total points earned Grade
315 – 350 A
280 – 314 B
245 – 279 C
210 – 244 D
below 210 F */
