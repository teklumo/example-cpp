/* Write a program that calculates the total grade for N classroom exercises as a percentage. 
The user should input the value for N followed by each of the N scores and totals. Calculate 
the overall percentage (sum of the total points earned divided by the total points possible) 
and output it as a percentage. Sample input and output is shown below.
How many exercises to input? 3
Score received for exercise 1: 10
Total points possible for exercise 1: 10
Score received for exercise 2: 7
Total points possible for exercise 2: 12
Score received for exercise 3: 5
Total points possible for exercise 3: 8
Your total is 22 out of 30, or 73.33%. */
