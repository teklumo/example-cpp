/* 14. Write a program to input 10 integer numbers in an array named fmax and determine the 
maximum and minimum value entered. Your program should contain only one
loop, and the maximum and minimum should be determined as array element values are 
being input. (Hint: Set the minimum equal to zero and the maximum equal to the first array 
element, which should be input before the loop used to input the remaining array values.) 
Keeping track of both the minimum and maximum element in the array and the index 
number for the minimum and maximum; after displaying the numbers, print these thre 
messages (replacing the underlines with the correct values):
 The minimum value is: ___ which is element number ___ in the list of numbers 
 The maximum value is: ___ which is element number ___ in the list of numbers */
