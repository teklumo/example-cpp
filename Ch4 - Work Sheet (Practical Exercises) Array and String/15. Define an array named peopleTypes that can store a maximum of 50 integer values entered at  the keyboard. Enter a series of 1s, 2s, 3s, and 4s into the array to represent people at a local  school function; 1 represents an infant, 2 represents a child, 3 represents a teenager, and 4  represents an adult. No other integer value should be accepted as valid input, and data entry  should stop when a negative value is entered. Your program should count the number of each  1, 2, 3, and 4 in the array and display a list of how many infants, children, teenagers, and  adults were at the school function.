/* 15. Define an array named peopleTypes that can store a maximum of 50 integer values entered at 
the keyboard. Enter a series of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s into the array to represent people at a local 
school function; 1 represents an infant, 2 represents a child, 3 represents a teenager, and 4 
represents an adult. No other integer value should be accepted as valid input, and data entry 
should stop when a negative value is entered. Your program should count the number of each 
1, 2, 3, and 4 in the array and display a list of how many infants, children, teenagers, and 
adults were at the school function.
