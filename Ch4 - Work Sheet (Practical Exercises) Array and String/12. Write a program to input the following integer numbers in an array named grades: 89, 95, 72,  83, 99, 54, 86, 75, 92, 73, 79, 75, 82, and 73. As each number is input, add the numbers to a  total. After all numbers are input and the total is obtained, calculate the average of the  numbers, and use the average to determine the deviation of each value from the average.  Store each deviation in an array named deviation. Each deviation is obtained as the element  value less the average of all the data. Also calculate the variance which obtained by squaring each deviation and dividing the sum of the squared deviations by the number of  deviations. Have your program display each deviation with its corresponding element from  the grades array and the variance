/* 12. Write a program to input the following integer numbers in an array named grades: 89, 95, 72, 
83, 99, 54, 86, 75, 92, 73, 79, 75, 82, and 73. As each number is input, add the numbers to a 
total. After all numbers are input and the total is obtained, calculate the average of the 
numbers, and use the average to determine the deviation of each value from the average. 
Store each deviation in an array named deviation. Each deviation is obtained as the element 
value less the average of all the data. Also calculate the variance which obtained by
squaring each deviation and dividing the sum of the squared deviations by the number of 
deviations. Have your program display each deviation with its corresponding element from 
the grades array and the variance */
