/*  Write a program that reads in ten whole numbers and that outputs the sum of all the numbers 
greater than zero, the sum of all the numbers less than zero (which will be a negative number 
or zero), and the sum of all the numbers, whether positive, negative, or zero. The user enters 
the ten numbers just once each and the user can enter them in any order. Your
program should not ask the user to enter the positive numbers and the negative numbers 
separately. */
