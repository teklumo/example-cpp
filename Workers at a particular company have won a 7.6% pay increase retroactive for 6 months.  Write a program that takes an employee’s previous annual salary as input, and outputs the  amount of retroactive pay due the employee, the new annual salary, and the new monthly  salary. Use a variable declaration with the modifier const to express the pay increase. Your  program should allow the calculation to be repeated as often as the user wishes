/* Workers at a particular company have won a 7.6% pay increase retroactive for 6 months. 
Write a program that takes an employeeâ€™s previous annual salary as input, and outputs the 
amount of retroactive pay due the employee, the new annual salary, and the new monthly 
salary. Use a variable declaration with the modifier const to express the pay increase. Your 
program should allow the calculation to be repeated as often as the user wishes. * /
